# App Directory

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This directory contains the core navigation structure and screen layouts for the MealMate application, leveraging Expo Router for file-based routing.

## Key Components / Files

- `_layout.tsx`: The root layout component for the entire application. It sets up the main navigation stack using `expo-router`, configures the `ThemeProvider` based on the color scheme, manages the splash screen visibility, and defines the top-level navigation screens.
- `+not-found.tsx`: Defines the screen displayed when a route is not found. Provides a link back to the home screen.

## Subdirectories

- `(capture)/`: Contains screens related to capturing images of ingredients.
- `(onboarding)/`: Contains screens related to the user onboarding flow.
- `(tabs)/`: Defines the main tab-based navigation structure after login/onboarding.
- `recipe/`: Contains screens for displaying individual recipe details.

## Routing

Routing is handled by Expo Router. Directories enclosed in parentheses, like `(tabs)`, represent route groups that don't add segments to the URL path but organize routes and layouts. Files like `_layout.tsx` define layouts for their segment and child routes. `+not-found.tsx` is a special file that catches unmatched routes.
