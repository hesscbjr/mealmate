# Recipe Detail Screens (`app/recipe/`)

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This directory contains the screens responsible for displaying the details of a specific recipe.

## Key Components / Files

- `_layout.tsx`: Defines the stack navigator layout for the recipe detail screens. It ensures that a header is shown for these screens.
- `[id].tsx`: A dynamic route screen that displays the details for a recipe based on the `id` parameter passed in the route. It fetches recipe details using the `useRecipeDetails` hook, handles loading, not found, and error states, and renders various components to display the recipe information (title, image, summary, ingredients, instructions, related recipes). It also allows starring/unstarring the recipe (`useRecipeStore`) and opening the original recipe source URL in a web browser.

## Navigation

- Users typically navigate to this screen from the recipe list (e.g., on the `preview` screen or potentially the `StarredRecipesSection` on the Home tab), passing the recipe `id` and optionally `missedCount` as parameters.
- The `_layout.tsx` ensures these screens are presented within a stack with a header.
- The header includes a back button (managed by `useLayoutEffect` in `[id].tsx`) to return to the previous screen and a star icon to toggle the recipe's starred status.

## State Management

- `[id].tsx` uses the `useRecipeStore` to check if the current recipe is starred and to toggle its starred status.
- It fetches recipe data via the `useRecipeDetails` hook, which likely handles its own internal state for loading and errors.
