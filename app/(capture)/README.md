# Capture Screens (`app/(capture)/`)

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This directory holds the screens related to capturing or selecting an image of ingredients.

## Key Components / Files

- `_layout.tsx`: Defines the stack navigator layout for the capture flow. It includes screens for capturing and previewing images. The header is hidden for the `capture` screen but shown for the `preview` screen.
- `capture.tsx`: The main screen for taking a photo using the device camera or selecting one from the image library. It handles camera permissions (`useCapturePermissions`), camera controls (facing toggle, take picture), image picker integration, and navigation to the `preview` screen upon capturing/selecting an image.
- `preview.tsx`: Displays the captured or selected image. It extracts ingredients from the image (`useIngredientExtraction`), suggests recipes based on those ingredients (`useRecipeSuggestions`), and handles loading/error states. Includes an animation (`usePreviewAnimation`) transitioning the image from full-screen to a smaller preview size.

## Navigation

- Users typically navigate here from another part of the app (e.g., a 'Capture' button on the main tabs).
- From `capture.tsx`, taking or selecting a photo pushes the `preview.tsx` screen onto the stack, passing the `imageUri` as a parameter.
- `preview.tsx` provides navigation back to the previous screen (likely `capture.tsx` or the screen that initiated the capture flow).
- The `_layout.tsx` file manages the stack presentation for these screens within the `(capture)` route group.
