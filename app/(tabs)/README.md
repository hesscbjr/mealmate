# Tab Navigation Screens (`app/(tabs)/`)

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This directory defines the main tab-based navigation interface of the application, accessible after the user completes onboarding.

## Key Components / Files

- `_layout.tsx`: Configures the `Tabs` navigator provided by Expo Router. It defines the tabs (Home, Explore, Profile), their icons, active tint color, and handles redirection to the onboarding flow (`/(onboarding)/welcome`) if `completedOnboarding` is false in the user store.
- `index.tsx` (Home Tab): The main landing screen. It displays a greeting (`Greeting` component), a button to navigate to the image capture flow (`/(capture)/capture`), and a section for starred recipes (`StarredRecipesSection`).
- `explore.tsx` (Explore Tab): Currently contains placeholder text and a button to clear user state from AsyncStorage (for development/debugging purposes).
- `profile.tsx` (Profile Tab): Displays the user's name and provides settings toggles for theme preference (`ThemePreferenceToggle`) and recipe recommendation sorting (`RecipeSortPreferenceToggle`), interacting with the `useUserStore`.

## Navigation

- This layout is the primary navigation method after onboarding.
- The `_layout.tsx` handles the tab bar UI and navigation between the `index`, `explore`, and `profile` screens.
- The Home screen (`index.tsx`) provides navigation to the image capture flow.

## State Management

- `_layout.tsx`: Reads `completedOnboarding` from `useUserStore` to determine if the user should be redirected to onboarding.
- `index.tsx`: Reads starred recipes from `useRecipeStore`.
- `profile.tsx`: Reads and updates theme preference and recipe sort preference using `useUserStore`.
- `explore.tsx`: Interacts with `AsyncStorage` directly to clear user data (intended for development).
