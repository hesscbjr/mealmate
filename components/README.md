# Components Directory (`components/`)

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This directory houses all reusable UI components for the MealMate application, organized according to the Atomic Design methodology.

## Structure (Atomic Design)

- **`atoms/`**: The smallest, indivisible UI elements. These are the fundamental building blocks.
  - Examples: `Button`, `Text`, `Icon`, `Input`.
  - Atoms should not contain application logic or state beyond their own internal UI state (e.g., hover/focus effects).
- **`molecules/`**: Combinations of atoms functioning together as a unit.
  - Examples: `RecipeCard` (combining Image, Text, Icon atoms), `SearchBar` (Input + Button atoms), `IconButton` (Icon + TouchableOpacity).
  - Molecules might have slightly more complexity but generally remain presentational.
- **`organisms/`**: More complex UI components composed of atoms and molecules, representing distinct sections of an interface.
  - Examples: `RecipeList`, `CameraView`, `OnboardingContainer`, `PermissionGate`.
  - Organisms can sometimes contain more complex UI logic but should ideally still receive data and callbacks as props.

## Import Rules

- `organisms` can import from `molecules` and `atoms`.
- `molecules` can import from `atoms`.
- `atoms` **must not** import from `molecules` or `organisms`.

## Development Guidelines

- **Self-Contained**: Components should be as self-contained as possible, receiving data and behavior via props.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a clear, single purpose.
- **Styling**: Follow the styling guidelines defined in the main project `README.md` (using `StyleSheet.create`, `useThemeColor`, and inline dynamic styles).
- **Props**: Use TypeScript interfaces for prop definitions. Prefer direct function components unless `React.FC` is necessary.
- **Reusability**: Design components with reusability in mind.
- **READMEs**: Each subdirectory (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`) must contain its own `README.md` detailing its purpose and contents.
