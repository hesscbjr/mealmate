# Molecules

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## Purpose

This directory contains "molecule" components according to the Atomic Design methodology. Molecules are relatively simple combinations of atoms working together as a unit to form a distinct piece of the UI.

Examples:

- A search input field combined with a button.
- A user avatar with a username label.
- A card component displaying summary information (like `RecipeCard`).

## Key Components / Files

- `ExpandableText.tsx`: Displays text that can be collapsed to a specific number of lines, with a "Show more" / "Show less" button.
- `FullScreenMessage.tsx`: A reusable component for displaying full-screen messages (e.g., loading, error, info) with optional icons, titles, subtitles, and action buttons. Supports fade-in animation.
- `Greeting.tsx`: Displays a personalized greeting message using the user's first name from the `useUserStore`.
- `IconButton.tsx`: A pressable button that only displays an `Icon` atom. Uses `TouchableOpacityHaptic` for feedback.
- `IngredientListDisplay.tsx`: Renders a formatted string of ingredients, prefixed with a shopping cart icon.
- `IngredientsList.tsx`: Renders a list of recipe ingredients with a title.
- `InstructionsList.tsx`: Renders recipe instructions, handling both structured (`AnalyzedInstruction`) and raw string formats.
- `LoadingOverlay.tsx`: An overlay component shown during loading states, often featuring animated text like `TypewriterText`.
- `NoRecipesFound.tsx`: A specific `FullScreenMessage` displayed when no recipes are found for given ingredients.
- `RecipeCard.tsx`: Displays a summary card for a recipe, including image, title, basic info (time, servings, missing ingredients), and a short summary. Links to the recipe detail screen. Includes a `RecipeCardSkeleton` for loading states.
- `RecipeError.tsx`: A specific `FullScreenMessage` displayed when there's an error loading a recipe.
- `RecipeNotFound.tsx`: A specific `FullScreenMessage` displayed when a specific recipe ID cannot be found.
- `RecipeSortPreferenceToggle.tsx`: Provides buttons to toggle between recipe sorting preferences (`max-used-ingredients`, `min-missing-ingredients`).
- `RecipeTitle.tsx`: Displays the main title and meta information (prep time, servings, missing ingredients) for a recipe detail screen.
- `RelatedRecipesList.tsx`: Displays a list of related recipe titles, linking to their respective detail screens.
- `Stagger.tsx`: A container that animates its children using `FadeInView` with a staggered delay.
- `ThemePreferenceToggle.tsx`: Provides buttons (`light`, `dark`, `system`) to select the application's theme preference.
- `TypewriterText.tsx`: Displays text with a typewriter effect, cycling through an array of messages with haptic feedback.

## Interactions

Molecules typically combine atoms (`components/atoms/`) to create slightly more complex UI elements. They should remain presentation-focused and generally do not contain complex application logic or data fetching, receiving necessary data and callbacks via props.

## Development Guidelines

- Molecules should be self-contained and reusable.
- They receive data and callbacks via props.
- Import atoms from `components/atoms/`.
- Do not import from `components/organisms/`.

## Usage

Import molecules directly into organisms or screen components where needed.

```tsx
import RecipeCard from "@/components/molecules/RecipeCard";
import Greeting from "@/components/molecules/Greeting";
// ... other imports

const MyScreen = () => {
  // ... state and logic
  return (
    <View>
      <Greeting />
      {/* ... other components */}
      <RecipeCard recipe={someRecipeData} loading={isLoading} />
      {/* ... other components */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
