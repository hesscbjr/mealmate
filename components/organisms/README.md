# Organisms

(Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## Purpose

This directory contains organism-level components according to Atomic Design principles. Organisms are complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms, representing distinct sections or major pieces of functionality within the application's interface.

## Key Components

- `IngredientSection.tsx`: Manages the display of extracted ingredients, recipe suggestions, and associated states (errors, no ingredients found). It orchestrates `IngredientListDisplay`, `RecipeList`, `FullScreenMessage`, `Stagger`, and `Button` (for refreshing recipes).
- `OnboardingContainer.tsx`: Provides a consistent layout container for onboarding screens, featuring a `LinearGradient` background and using `Stagger` to animate the entrance of its children.
- `PermissionGate.tsx`: A conditional rendering component that checks a permission status (`loading`, `denied`, `granted`). It shows a loading indicator, a denial message with action buttons (using `FullScreenMessage`), or the child components based on the status.
- `RecipeDetailSkeleton.tsx`: Displays a skeleton loading state for the recipe detail screen, mimicking the layout with shimmering placeholders.
- `RecipeList.tsx`: Renders a list of recipes using `RecipeCard` components within a `FlashList`. Handles loading states (showing `RecipeCardSkeleton`), error states, and an empty state (using `NoRecipesFound`).
- `StarredEmptyState.tsx`: Displays a message and an image indicating that the user has no starred recipes yet. Used within `StarredRecipesSection`.
- `StarredRecipesSection.tsx`: Displays a titled section for starred recipes. It renders either the `RecipeList` (if there are starred recipes) or the `StarredEmptyState`.

## Interactions

- Organisms orchestrate the display and interaction of multiple smaller components (atoms and molecules).
- They typically receive data (e.g., `ingredientData`, `recipes`, `starredRecipes`) and callbacks (e.g., `onRetry`, `refreshRecipes`) as props from screen-level components or state management hooks/stores.

## Development Guidelines

- Organisms should encapsulate a significant piece of UI functionality or a major section of a screen.
- Aim to keep organisms primarily focused on layout and composition. Avoid embedding complex business logic or direct data fetching; pass necessary data and handlers down as props.
- Import components primarily from `components/molecules/` and `components/atoms/`.

## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Example usage within a screen component (e.g., PreviewScreen)
import IngredientSection from "@/components/organisms/IngredientSection";
import { useIngredientExtraction } from "@/hooks/useIngredientExtraction";
import { useRecipeSuggestions } from "@/hooks/useRecipeSuggestions";

function PreviewScreen() {
  const {
    data: ingredientData,
    loading: ingredientLoading,
    error: ingredientError,
  } = useIngredientExtraction(imageUri);
  const {
    recipes,
    loading: recipeLoading,
    error: recipeError,
    refreshRecipes,
  } = useRecipeSuggestions(ingredientData?.ingredients);

  // ... other logic ...

  return (
    <IngredientSection
      ingredientData={ingredientData}
      ingredientError={ingredientError}
      onRetry={handleGoBack} // Assuming handleGoBack exists
      recipes={recipes}
      recipeError={recipeError}
      recipeLoading={recipeLoading}
      refreshRecipes={refreshRecipes}
    />
  );
}
```
