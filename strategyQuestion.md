# Strategy Question

I absolutely agree with your premise. Just like the internet boom was not really about the technology itself but about reshaping industries and solving old problems in new ways, the true power of AI lies in applying it intelligently to the challenges we already face.

After college, my first job was at a startup that spun out of a construction company in the electrical contracting business. I was surpised by how low-tech the operation was. Part of it stemmed from an older workforce, but, the industry as a whole was fundamentally underserved by software. The tools that did exist often felt like clunky versions of Excel, laggy and mismatched for the complexity of the work they had to do.

The one bright spot was the Virtual Design and Construction, or VDC, team. They used great tools like Autodesk Revit to create 3D models of buildings. But even there, the process was painstakingly manual. I watched them spend hours meticulously routing every pipe and electrical conduit, double and triple-checking every move. Mistakes in their model had real-world consequences both financially and in terms of safety.

They also had to operate in projects with multiple teams. One VDC team for electrical, one for plumbing, one for HVAC, etc., etc. Ensuring your changes didn't mess with another teams was diffcult and time consuming. VDC teams haven't quite figured out pull requests yet.

Software like Revit has features like simple clash detection, however, they are fundamentally reactive. They only flagged issues after the design was already in place. The crucial work of creating and coordinating these models remained overwhelmingly manual.

It was obvious to me that VDC teams need their own version of Cursor. A smart, embedded AI that does not just check for problems after the fact but actively helps design, suggest optimizations, and catch mistakes in real time. But this is not very novel, I even called it "Cursor for VDC".

The real opportunity is even bigger than that. Construction project communication is notoriously fragmented. Owners hire architects to design the building. Architects hand off to general contractors. General contractors coordinate multiple subcontractors. Subcontractors estimate how much the work is going to cost based on a drawing and build their own models through separate VDC teams. Hell, sometimes the VDC team is a separate offshore contracting company from the subcontractor. Every handoff adds more distance between the people who want answers and the people who have them. By the time an owner wants to check how the electrical design is progressing or request a simple design adjustment, they are often twenty people removed from the team actually doing the work.

There is a massive opportunity to build an AI-driven system that adapts based on who is using it.

As an owner, you should be able to ask clear, natural questions like “How close is the current model to the original design?” or “Can we make the ceilings taller on the third floor?” without needing to understand the technical backend. The AI should be able to take that request, translate it into detailed design terms, answer your question or direct it to the appropriate teams.

As an architect, you should be able to instantly compare your original vision to the current state of the model, with AI highlighting deviations and providing suggestions to bring things back into alignment.

As a VDC team member, the AI should handle the tedious but critical tasks like initial layout suggestions, clash resolution proposals, and real-time code compliance checks. It should also be capable of model element generation (again, Cursor for VDC).

As an estimator, you should be able to pull live pricing from suppliers, tie it directly into the current progress of the model, and generate evolving cost forecasts that adjust every day as the project evolves. Construction estimates are notorious for being frozen guesses at one point in time and AI + software has the possibility to make these estimates match the status of the project.

Even in the field, the value would be massive. Today, when an installer encounters an unexpected problem and needs to submit a change order, the process is slow and painful. First, the installer has to document the issue, often through paper forms or photos. Then, the request is passed up the chain to the VDC or BIM team. A designer manually updates the model, re-coordinates with other teams, and finally sends back new drawings for field installation. The typical turnaround for a full field-to-model-to-field change order today is around 24 to 30 days. I once talked to the VDC manager I knew and he told me a story where a conduit needed a 45% bend instead of a 40% bend and it took 47 days from the request to installation. That is an enormous delay in an industry where time quite literally is money. I could see an installer simply speaking into their phone where the AI listens, understands the change request, checks it against the existing model, generates a pull request-style update, and notifies the VDC manager. The manager can approve, modify, or reject the change within hours. The updated model is then immediately available to the field team, eliminating weeks of downtime.

Looking into the future, AR and VR technology could make this even tighter. Installers could wear smart glasses that cross-reference their installation work with the 3D model in real time. If a deviation is detected, the system could automatically propose a correction or create a suggested change order on the fly. In the long run, every installer could work with an AI copilot by their side, ensuring the physical building matches the digital model as closely as possible while flagging and adjusting to real-world conditions on the jobsite. This however, I feel may be farther off with spatial reasoning and precision, from the tech we have today.

This system would not just be a single agent trying to do everything at once. It would be a coordinated group of specialized agents working together behind the scenes. The platform would orchestrate them depending on the user’s role and the task at hand. That is where the real power lies. One system that feels completely different depending on who is using it. One system that translates between owners, architects, estimators, VDC teams, and installers without forcing them to all speak the same technical language.

Of course, there are significant challenges. Sourcing enough high-quality, labeled Revit model data for training is a major hurdle. The required precision is also far beyond typical generative tasks because “close enough” does not work when you are designing building infrastructure. It is the same reason why “vibe coding” is fine for some apps but not for a high-risk system.

Another limitation is context coherence. These 3D models are massive. Files can easily span hundreds of thousands of lines and today’s LLMs struggle with large enough projects, similar to how they struggle with huge codebases.

Further, visualization tools for architects and owners would need high precision too. With native image generation from GPT-4o and Gemini we are getting closer, however, I do find it a ways off to trust a generated render of a building based on a 3D model screenshot.

But these challenges also create a significant competitive advantage. Solving the data problem and achieving the necessary level of precision would build a powerful moat around the product. I believe this will likely come from an incumbent like Autodesk, combining their data with a powerful model from an AI lab. They are trying, but so far their AI integrations feel more like boilerplate generators than serious production-ready tools. A more novel approach favoring startups would be to change the underlying structure of these 3D models to make them more friendly will LLMs. However, this runs into a similar, and even sparser, lack of data problem.

On top of that, model context coherence is improving rapidly. Every week it seems models become more capable of handling longer and more complicated contexts. This makes a system like this feel less theoretical and more inevitable. The end result would be transformative. Construction teams could move faster, reduce rework, lower costs, and bid on more projects with higher confidence. Subcontractors could win more bids and make more money without needing to add more manpower.

Thinking about all of this, I remember seeing [this video](https://x.com/sharifshameem/status/1284095222939451393) of GPT-3 generating working React code. This was from July of 2020. Seeing [similar videos like this](https://x.com/aaditsh/status/1912439645423522233) makes me think 3D modeling tools are at, if not farther along, the same plan

And although I know construction best, I imagine this trend will extend far beyond it. Any industry that struggles with complex technical handoffs, fragmented communication, or slow iteration cycles could benefit from a system of coordinated AI agents that adapt to the user’s role and fill in translation gaps between teams with different areas of expertise.
